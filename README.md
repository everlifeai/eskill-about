# About You

`elife-about` is a base skill that allows the avatar to gather
information about it's owner. This information can be public - used by
other avatars for jobs or networking, or private - a legacy of sorts that
is preserved for the future.

For now, the avatar responds to the `whoami` query, allowing the user to
know his `Everchain` identity.
